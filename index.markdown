## Building Safe Software Is Hard — Let’s Make It Easier.

Finding a bug in production is painful - especially, when it comes to a safety critical system.
It costs time, money, and energy that teams can’t afford to lose.
That’s the reality for many organizations working in safety-critical environments.

How can we make safety-critical software development **faster, more reliable, and more predictable**?
How can we **catch errors early**, before they reach expensive validation or series production?
And how can we **save resources** by doing things right the first time?

## There Must Be a Better Way

After years in automotive and safety‑critical development, I’ve seen how even experienced teams face the same recurring challenges: complex architectures, scattered toolchains, and demanding traceability requirements.
None of this happens because people don’t care — it’s simply the nature of building safe systems under real‑world constraints.

The result? Delays, rework, and high costs when issues surface late in the lifecycle.

## Rust Helps

With **Rust**, we can move some of these challenges upstream.

Rust supports functional safety by enforcing correctness at compile time, enabling verifiable architectures, and simplifying evidence for safety cases.
Its strong typing and deterministic behavior align naturally with standards like **ISO 26262**, **DO‑178C**, and **IEC 61508**, helping teams build certifiable systems with less overhead.

Beyond code, Rust lets you validate design decisions early.
Its type system and verification tools catch issues before testing begins, reducing what needs to be tested later.
This **shift‑left** approach shortens cycles, improves confidence, and lowers cost.

You get:
- Deterministic, memory‑ and thread‑safe software
- Early validation of functional correctness
- Faster integration and feedback
- Fewer runtime paths to test
- Lower total cost of quality

Early bug detection isn’t just a technical win — it’s a business win.

## What I Offer

Here’s how I can help your team:

- **Consulting** – Guidance for transitioning legacy C/C++ systems to Rust, designing safer architectures, and building deterministic systems for safety‑critical applications.
  I also help improve functional‑safety workflows (e.g., ISO 26262, DO‑178, IEC 62304): requirement traceability, safety‑case support, verification planning, and toolchain qualification tailored to Rust integration.
  And yes — I can support your leadership with the technical and business justification for adopting Rust.

- **Training** – Practical, hands‑on workshops that make Rust approachable for embedded and safety engineers.

- **Development Support** – I work alongside your team or independently to deliver robust, production‑ready Rust code.
  I also handle porting legacy code to Rust or integrating it with existing C and C++ systems — ensuring smooth interoperability and improved safety.

## About Me

I’m **Arnaud Riess**, with over 15 years of experience in automotive and safety‑critical embedded software development (ISO 26262).
From Classic and Adaptive AUTOSAR to middleware and RTOS programming in C and C++, I’ve seen the good, the bad, and the ~~ugly~~ rusty 🦀.

Now I help organizations modernize their toolchains and development culture with Rust — without compromising safety or certification goals.
