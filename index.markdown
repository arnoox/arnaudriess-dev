# Building Safe Software Shouldn't Be This Hard

Finding a bug in production — or worse, in a car on the road or a medical device in use — sucks.
It's expensive, stressful, and costs enormous amounts of time and energy.
But that's the reality for many teams still fighting with C and C++ in safety-critical environments.

How can we make safety-critical software development **faster, more reliable, and more predictable**?
How can we **catch errors early**, before they reach the expensive Erprobung or series?
And how can we **save resources** by doing things right the first time?

## The Challenge

In automotive, avionics, medical, and defense industries, developers struggle with:
- Concurrency and memory bugs that slip through testing
- TODO: "really? make this better;" Inflexible, license-heavy toolchains
- TODO: "really? make this better;" Complex integration across suppliers and systems
- TODO: "really? make this better;" Poor traceability between requirements, tests, and code

The result? Delays, rework, and massive costs when defects are found late in the process.

## There Must Be a Better Way

With **Rust**, we can change that.

Rust's compile-time guarantees, type system, and modern tooling ecosystem eliminate entire categories of runtime errors. But it's not only about writing safer code: it's about building better systems from the start. Rust's expressive type system make it possible to validate design decisions early, reducing what needs to be tested later. You can even extend these checks with formal verification tools from the Rust ecosystem to ensure architectural consistency and safety goals are met before runtime.

This **shift-left** approach moves validation from testing to design and compile time, saving effort, shortening development cycles, and increasing confidence in your software.

You get:
- Deterministic, memory-safe software
- Easier integration
- Faster feedback cycles
- Fewer paths to test
- Lower total cost of quality

Early bug detection isn't just a technical win; it's a business win.

## What I Offer

**Consulting**: I help teams transition from legacy C/C++ to Rust, design safer architectures, and build deterministic systems for safety-critical use cases. And yes, I can also convince your management that this is the way to go.

**Training**: Practical, hands-on workshops that make Rust approachable for embedded and safety engineers.

**Development Support**: I work alongside your team to deliver robust, production-ready Rust code — or review and harden what you already have.

## About Me
I'm **Arnaud Riess**, with 15+ years in automotive and safety critical embedded software development: from Classic and Adaptive AUTOSAR to middleware and RTOS programming in C and C++. I've firsthand seen the good, the bad and the ~~ugly~~ rusty 🦀

Now, I help organizations modernize their toolchains and development culture with Rust — without compromising safety or certification goals.
